/**

 * <p>The fourth copy of this logic on the platform, and deliberately the smallest. It holds the signing
 * key solely to check that a token was issued by user-service and has not expired — there is no
 * {@code generate}, no users table, no password encoder and no login route anywhere in this module. A
 * component that can mint credentials is a component that has to be audited, and this one is the piece
 * of the platform exposed to the public internet.
 *
 * <p>No {@code Role} enum either, for the reason Step 5a established: an unrecognised role must not
 * throw inside the edge filter. It travels as a string, and an unknown one simply fails whatever
 * authorization rule it is later measured against.
