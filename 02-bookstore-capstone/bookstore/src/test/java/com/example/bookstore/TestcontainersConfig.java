/**
 * A real PostgreSQL, started by the test run and discarded when it ends.
 *
 * <p>{@code @ServiceConnection} is what makes this a two-line affair: Spring Boot reads the container's
 * host, port, database, and credentials once it is running and wires the DataSource from them. No
 * {@code @DynamicPropertySource}, no properties to keep in sync with the compose file.
 *
 * <p><strong>The version is pinned to match production.</strong> Testing against a different database
 * than you deploy on is testing something else — and the same image tag as {@code docker-compose.yml}
 * means a behaviour difference between local and CI is a real difference, not a version skew.
 *
 * <p>Spring caches the application context across test classes that share the same configuration, so
 * the container starts once for the whole suite rather than once per class.
